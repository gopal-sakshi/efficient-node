Node ecosystem – vs – Node runtime 

Ecosystem   = express, socketIO
runtime     = V8, callstack

============================================

`Call Stack`
- data structure 
- that V8 uses 
- to keep track of function invocations.
- you only get ONE Call Stack per Node process. 
- If you keep that Call Stack busy, your whole Node process is busy. 


`Event Loop`
- provided by the libuv library. 
- It is <not part> of V8.
